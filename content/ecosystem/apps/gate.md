Logging in to any Urbit app requires you to input your ship's URL and the `+code` generated on dojo. This requires people to login to their ship's terminal, output the code on dojo, then copy and paste it in their browser or app. This is bad enough if you have a ship running locally, but if you have it running remotely (as is common) the process becomes seriously annoying.

Mainstream mobile apps such as Signal handle first login much more seamlessly; after registration is done, further logins are done via QR code. The app produces a QR code, you scan it, and that's it. That's the state-of-the-art, battle-tested user experience for modern applications. Now available on Urbit.

Gate makes it easier for newcomers to use Urbit, and greatly enhances the user experience of native applications, desktop and mobile, that Urbit deserves.

Users can login to Urbit just by scanning a QR code, receive a URL link and login to an Urbit ship instantly by clicking on it. That simple. Most importantly, hosting providers can use Gate to send a QR code or a URL link to a user, and have the user access his Urbit apps with a simple camera scan or click of a link, making the onboarding process much easier for non-technical users.
