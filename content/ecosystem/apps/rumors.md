Rumors is an anonymous gossip feed powered by [pals](/applications/~paldev/pals). The more mutuals you have, the more rumors you'll see: messages posted by your pals, and their pals, populate the feed.

Built using a p2p gossip protocol, rumors anonymizes posts and orders them chronologically. Drop links, ask questions, lurk, or whisper secrets into the void â€¦
