Need a personal website, fast? Studio can set one up in under a minute. For writers, Studio connects you with your legacy-web audience, even if they’re not on Urbit yet. With a click, you can share your newsletter or blog via auto-generated blog or email distribution list

Studio pulls content from your Groups notebooks. Notebooks from any group you own will appear.

If you need any help, we’re always available in our group: ~tirrel/tirrel-support
