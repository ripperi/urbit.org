It's been almost two months since Assembly and the last cohort of Hoon School Live has just finished. The year is drawing to a close and the Urbit developer community is getting bigger every day. This calls for a celebration.

From the 14th through the 18th of November the Urbit Foundation is organizing a week full of announcements, thoughtful conversations, launches, and more.
