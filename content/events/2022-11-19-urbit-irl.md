Please join us for a park meetup (picnic optional!) at Alamo Square Park in San Francisco, on Saturday, 11/19. We'll meet at 1:00PM and stay as long as people want to chat. Bring a jacket and your choice of food/drink.
Interested friends and the Urbit-curious are always welcome!

We'll meet in the SW corner of the park, on Hayes St near the dog area.
