We didn't get to cover all we wanted last time and there were lots of outstanding questions, so let's do another extra meetup, rather than wait another month!

Tentative topic: Urbit identity, art, and culture. What kind of expression is Urbit uniquely suited for? What would be some cool grants we could apply for?

We have temporarily changed locations to Muted Horn, one of the best craft beer pubs in Northern Europe with a cozy vibe. It is also possible to order food from nearby restaurants and eat there. If the weather is great we will be sitting outside.

Please RSVP to the Meetup.
