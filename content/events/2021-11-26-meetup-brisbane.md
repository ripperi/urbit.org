What is the Urbit??

Philosophers, mathematicians and other timewasters have pondered this tough question for aeons. Many went mad, others grew long beards or even buried themselves alive, thinking the riddle unsolvable. So did we... until now.

Urbit Brisbane are proud to announce that we finally have found an answer: yes, we have figured out what is the Urbit!!

We'd like to share this important knowledge with you, so join us among the fair hills of St Lucia this Friday night. The Secret Venue will be announced on Friday arvo. RSVP and stay tuned to the event page so you don't end up walking around Guyatt Park accosting joggers for clues.

Come along and learn about the Urbit with us. You will gain access to an eldritch power far beyond the frail grasp of worldly things. If that isn't enough to tempt you, we also have beers and pizza with your name on them.\*

\*If your name is Asahi or Godfather Supreme.
