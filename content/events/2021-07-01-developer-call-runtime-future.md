Please join us for a look behind the curtain at the Urbit Runtime. Host Ted Blackman (~rovnys-ricfer) will be interviewing Joe Bryan (~master-morzod). Topics will include event log truncation, plans for storing more than 2GB, multithreading implementation, and much more.

Ted Blackman (~rovnys-ricfer) has worked on Urbit since 2017, mostly on the kernel, with forays into the runtime and userspace. Before Urbit, he worked in sensor fusion, robotics, web development, distributed systems, and data engineering. He has a degree in physics from MIT.

As always, join us for happy hour after the talk.
