The first Urbit Berlin meetup at our new location: c-base!

If you are new to Urbit, this is a great time and place to learn more.

For this first meetup we will simply meet, mingle and discuss new and exciting things happening on the network, like: App School Live, Uqbar, Scene, Native Planet, and the upcoming Volcano Summit in El Salvador.

The vibe at c-base is great and retro-technological, there is an bar and we have a table booked just for us. There will be other Meetups on various technological and futuristic topics happening at the same time if you like to mingle around.

Please RSVP to the Meetup.
