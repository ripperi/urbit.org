The Urbit Foundation is sponsoring a prize in the [HackFS](https://fs.ethglobal.com/) competition with the [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io/) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) communities.

IPFS and Filecoin are distributed data storage and access solutions for a decentralized Web.  Building Urbit compatibility tools will lead to new ways of decentralizing file storage and distribution.
