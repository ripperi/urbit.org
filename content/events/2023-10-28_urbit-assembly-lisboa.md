This year’s Assembly takes place in Lisbon: Europe’s tech and crypto hub.
Assembly is the largest annual Urbit conference, bringing together Urbit organizations, developers & enthusiasts from around the world.

This year we’re doing something new. Immediately following Assembly there will be a week of side events organized by you: Urbit Week Lisboa.

We value IRL contact, therefore no talks will be live-streamed. Some recordings will be available after the event.
