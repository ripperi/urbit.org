# Rationale

A teaching assistant and developer will support App School Live and Hoon School
Live, including producing basic courseware tools as command-line apps and agents.
Some of this will involve further developing Urbit Forms or another backend to
facilitate grading of submissions and allow us to natively showcase that tool in
a course setting.

# Implementation

The basic spec for this proposal:

-   support teaching and grading ASL and HSL
-   course grading CLI tools (grading agent or thread from reference answer to student answer yielding final grade)
-   course admin CLI tools (gradebook store with DM reporting agent or thread)
-   maybe Urbit Forms upgrade/update (postponing)

(So about three agents/threads.)

# Compensation
Reward: 2 Stars
