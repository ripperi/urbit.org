[Books](https://urbit.org/grants/books) is an application for managing your crypto wallets, transactions, and counterparties. It allows you to add your wallet and other peopleâ€™s, track balances and transactions, and add private annotations to all of the above.


# Overview

Books was developed by Quartus and has is currently distributed from [~dister-dozzod-dalten](web+urbitgraph://~dister-dozzod-dalten/books). The Foundation has found internal use for Books and has decided to fund continued development for some key features.

## Features in scope

- Rolodex entries should support multiple public addresses.
- Transactions in the ledger should automatically be associated with known counterparties from the rolodex. The associations should happen even for transactions that happened before the rolodex entry was created.
- Books should recognize transactions involving Urbit stars.
- Books should be able to display balances.
- Books should issue notifications on incoming transactions.

## Implementation Notes

Books is distributed as a desk that contains `/app/books` and a frontend written in Vue. This bounty will require modifying the Urbit backend and the Vue frontend.

The source code for Books lives at https://github.com/dalten-collective/books.

## Milestones and Compensation
The applicant will receive 2 stars on completion of all the features in scope.
