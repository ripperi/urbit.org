### Stack Overflow Handling

Skill level: competent C programmer with a bit more experience; the contributor should have experience in kernel programming.

Time estimate: 8-12 weeks, including onboarding, weekly check-ins by video call, and chat check-ins as needed.

In some contexts, we don't check for overflows in road-stacks. This project would involve adding those checks, producing more accurate errors, and protecting against heap corruption.
A good starting point for this would be to protect a page at the bottom (top) of the road stack, and move it as appropriate.

Final work product:

- all protection sites identified
- overflow checks implemented at those sites
