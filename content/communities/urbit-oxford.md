Urbit Oxford is the UK's second Urbit meetup group, based around the University of Oxford and community members in the greater London region. Broadly, the group emphasizes on connectivity between extra-Oxford DAO's and startups and the Oxford community of students, researchers, and faculty. The goal of Urbit Oxford's meetups is to create a discussion and meeting space for individuals passionate about computing, digital sovereignty, and the future of Urbit. All are welcome!
