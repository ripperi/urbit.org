Apprenticeships are practical learning opportunities for new Urbit developers provided by experienced members of the Urbit development community. As an apprentice, you'll have the opportunity to:

- Learn from an experienced Urbit contributor
- Make helpful contributions to an active project, and
- Earn address space for learning

Becoming an apprentice is easily one of the best ways to level up your skills, and perhaps even land a job.

## Get started

Apprenticeships are for those that are new to Urbit development (or an area of it), and would like to find their grounding by working on a pre-existing codebase and problem set. Nearly all apprenticeships involve some degree of Hoon work, so you should make sure that you've completed [Hoon School](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/hoon-school) and [App School](https://developers.urbit.org/guides/core/app-school/intro) in either their asychronous or [cohort formats](https://developers.urbit.org/courses) prior to signing up.

To become an apprentice, [apply for an open apprenticeship](/grants?program=apprenticeship&open=true&wip=false&completed=false#view-grants)

Although some apprenticeships are posted on this site to be claimed, more often than not they emerge out of a conversation between a mentor and an enthusiastic potential apprentice. This is because mentors are generally busy engineering, and while they know many things that need to be done, getting those ideas into writing is difficult.

## How it works

Once a mentor has written up an apprenticeship, and approved an apprentice, The Urbit Foundation will perform a quick KYC step and send contracts to all parties for signing. Once those contracts are executed, work can proceed.

Mentors and apprentices work together by having weekly pairing sessions and maintaining an open line of communication over Urbit. It's expected that mentors put at least two hours per week into supporting their apprentice.

## Funding

Apprenticeships pay 1 star upon the sucessful completion of the apprenticeship, for an apprenticeship of a duration of up to three months.

## Getting Paid

When you have completed the scope of your grant, you will create a detailed writeup of the work completed and your learnings, share the writeup with your mentor, and get your approval of completion. After recieving this approval from your mentor, please [submit an invoice here](https://airtable.com/shrXXCs1uaxtNSBcg). Your mentor must also contact `~marfun-pacpet` to confirm completion of the apprenticeship and approve the payment. Once the Urbit Foundation receives approval from your champion and an invoice for the amount agreed upon in your grant or milestone, the Foundation will pay your star allocation to the Ethereum address you have provided.

We approve and issue payments within 30 days of invoice receipt and approval, although often payment is made more quickly. If you have any questions regarding getting paid or submitting an invoice, please contact `~marfun-pacpet` for assistance.
