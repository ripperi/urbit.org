### Portal is sovereign social media

Portal is Urbit-native social media. It helps you discover all the wonderful apps, groups, and content on Urbit. Beyond being the global conversation hub of Urbit, it surfaces trending %groups messages, has an app store, and lets you tip your fellow Urbiters in ETH.

Soon you'll be able to build and monetize your own feed algorithm using LLMs, creating an open marketplace of highly personalized and novel content experiences. Portal also aims to build an LLM-powered virtual assistant that helps you be more productive, discover content, and fully leverage your Urbit superpowers.
