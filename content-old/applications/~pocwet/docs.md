Docs is an Urbit app for documenting other Urbit apps - it finds docs in other desks and displays them for users and deveopers to browse.

The docs folder contains the source of the app, and the docs-dev folder contains the files necessary for including docs in your app. Note that the files in docs-dev are symlinked, so the'll need to be copied with cp -rL or equivalent.
