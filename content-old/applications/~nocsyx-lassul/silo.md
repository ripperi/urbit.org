### An S3 storage manager

Silo is an application for viewing and managing your urbit's file storage. Currently that means the files in an S3-compatible storage system, but hopefully soon we'll also be able to provide an interface for your local urbit's filesystem too.

Currently silo allows you to upload, delete, add folders, and otherwise manage your files like you expect. It also offers easy access to downloading files and copying their URLs.

In the future we hope to add the ability to easily share files with others, offer storage to friends or groups, a fully urbit-side S3 and virtual filesystem API, and a drop-in file-picker component that devs can use to easily add image uploads to their apps.
