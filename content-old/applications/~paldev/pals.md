Pals is a contact list for your urbit friends. Send and receive friend requests with intuitive ease. Once you're pals, a smiley face icon indicates mutual status.

Keep track of who your pals are or how you know them with tags, which exist mostly for your own book-keeping, but could be used in the future by other applications to group content. Similarly, some apps work better with pals, like [rumors](/applications/~paldev/rumors), an anonymous gossip app, and [sphinx](/applications/~nocsyx-lassul/sphinx), an Urbit search engine.
