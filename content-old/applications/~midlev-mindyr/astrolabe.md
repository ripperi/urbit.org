### Astrolabe is a one-stop shop app for exploring Urbit address space.

Features: 

- **ID Search**: 
When you search a partial @p (or use wildcards), it will show you the spawned/owned ships which match your search. 

- **Sigil Search**: 
You can use a visual interface to enter sigils, either just general shapes, or specific shape/pattern combos

- **Sky Chart**: 
 Astrolabe integrates with %pals to highlight your pals on the sky chart. Clicking/tapping on a point opens a small modal with basic info and a button to take you to a Ship View of the point.

- **Ship View**: 
Summary view for any ship. As on urbit.live or urbit.me, it shows the @p, owner, parent, etc. Allows PNG or SVG download of sigils. Displays tags from %pals, and potentially allows you to add pals and/or edit tags from that screen.



Astrolabe integrates with pals wherever possible, and contains documentation to explain the many quirks of Urbit address space to a new user.
