I'm a software developer with over a decade of experience building custom, novel web and mobile applications for small and medium (and the occasional Fortune 500) businesses. I left the Earth web behind for Mars and have never been happier.  
I'm one of the full-time engineers at Quartus and a proud member of the Dalten Collective, where we're pioneering increasingly-proven methods of Sovereignty and Sustainability under the guiding light of Fellowship.

The future is bright.
