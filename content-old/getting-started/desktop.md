In the past we recommended [Port](https://github.com/urbit/port/releases), a desktop Urbit client.

We now recommend that users that are not comfortable with the [CLI interface](/getting-started/cli) run Urbit with a [hosting service](/getting-started/hosted) or an Urbit-native computer like [Native Planet](https://www.nativeplanet.io/).

Whichever way you run your urbit, you can also now use it with a desktop interface such as [Scene](https://tirrel.io/scene/index.html), or the soon-to-be released [Realm](https://www.holium.com/) application.
