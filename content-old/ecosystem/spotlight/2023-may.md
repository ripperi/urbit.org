The *Mars Review of Books*, a magazine in print and on Urbit, recently put out its third issue — with pieces from Sean Thor Conroe, Marc Hochstein, Miles Routledge, Peter Nimitz and more. And now for the first time, the *MRB* is selling digital and print subscriptions exclusively through Urbit.

Portal is a lot like this ecosystem section of the Urbit website, except *on Urbit*. It’s a great place to find Urbit apps, Urbit groups, and recent media about your favorite Urbit developers and community members.

Because Portal is on Urbit, networking among peers is built in. Anyone using Portal can curate their own list of apps and groups, and display that to other Portal users. It’s a great proof of concept for the way decentralized curation can work, a lot of fun to use, and the perfect place to start for anyone trying out Urbit for the first time.

You’ll have to check it out on Urbit at ~worpet-bildet/portal
