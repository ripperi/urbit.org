Zorp has built a secure-by-design zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) with a uniquely minimal software supply chain which utilizes Nock as its instruction set. Nock, Urbit’s low-level language, is a famously simple instruction set. That property aligns itself well with what you might create if you were designing a language from first principles to do zero-knowledge proofs. Zorp’s zkVM could unlock new possibilities for crypto and more. Check back at Zorp’s [website](https://zorp.io/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZorpZK) for more info.
