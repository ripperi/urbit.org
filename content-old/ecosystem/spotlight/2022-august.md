Tirrel has announced on their blog that Studio’s next release will include USD payments integration, allowing individuals to use Urbit to make a storefront and accept USD.

While most Urbit applications are focused on activity within the Urbit universe, Studio is unique in its focus on connecting the fiat and clearweb worlds to Urbit.
