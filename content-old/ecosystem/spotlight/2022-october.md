At Assembly 2022 Uqbar debuted their brand new developer toolkit: Ziggurat.  Ziggurat provides a unified development interface where programmers can write contracts, receive compiler feedback, and test on a fake chain. This promises a huge improvement on the developer experience for smart contracts and blockchain application development alike.  Note: As Ziggurat is in active development and undergoing frequent updates, Uqbar recommends installing Ziggurat on a moon rather than your primary ship.
