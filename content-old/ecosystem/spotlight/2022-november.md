Assembly Capital recently released radio, an app that lets you create or tune into rooms where you can collaboratively DJ with other users on the network.

Radio turns the algorithm-driven institution that is Youtube into an experience that's more like watching an old TV with just a few channels with your friends.

Developer ~nodmyn-dosrux writes "Radio is the first urbit app with presence built in. Accurate presence data creates a socially charged experience ... Presence gives people reason to engage with each other. Our natural social impulses disincentivize “lurking”, but this doesn’t work when software makes us invisible."
