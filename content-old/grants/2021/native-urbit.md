## Overview

The most pure Urbit experience will be one that is hosted at your home, on your desk at work, or where ever you want to keep a small well designed piece of hardware. This "box" will include a small but powerful chipset that will be custom built for Urbit's unique needs (Fast read/write speeds, a durable HD to hande re-writes, RAID Backup, and easily expandable storage). Ideally, this hardware to be presented as an open source hardware project. You will be able to purchase the Native Planet as a hacker kit or as a fully assembled piece of high-end hardware that offers a plug and play solution for less tech savvy users. Building hardware for Urbit is a bit of a moving target this early in the game, but hopefully building something that is modular, customizable, hackable, and powerful enough for now and the foreseeable future will both aid in development of future hardware as well as satisfy the needs of current users.

We are still early in the design phase, but we hope to have a fully built working prototype by the end of the 1st quarter 2022. We expect to have a working custom chipset within the next month and to start creating enclosure prototypes in January.
