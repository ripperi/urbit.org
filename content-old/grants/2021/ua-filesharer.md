An application that allows peers to upload files to managed storage, either on or off Urbit, and share files with each other. Can also add direct file-sharing via something like WebRTC in the future when that's ready.

### User Stories

As a user, I can:

- add custom marks to store new filetypes in Urbit
- choose a fileserver to connect to with LFS or S3 for larger binaries
- add files to my system, with metadata
- specify the users and groups that have access to my files
- view the files I have access to on other ships
- download files to my local machine
