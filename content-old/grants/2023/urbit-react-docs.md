## Rationale ##



The front-end React examples provided in Urbit's developer documentation (i.e. the ["Chat Lightning Tutorial"][ex-1] and ["App School II: Full-Stack"][ex-2] pages) use legacy, class-based React patterns that have largely been phased out over the past few years in favor of [modern, hook-based React style][re-hook]. These examples should be refactored to use this modern style to improve the developer onboarding experience (as increasing amounts of [React learning materials use hooks][re-tut]) and future-proof the material presented (as the official React documentation eventually migrates to [primarily present the modern style][re-docs]).



## Overview ##



The content for the Urbit React examples is split across two repositories:



1. [urbit/doc-examples][git-ex]: Contains the source code for the React examples.

2. [urbit/developers.urbit.org][git-org]: Contains the web-hosted documentation for the React examples, which can be viewed at [developers.urbit.org](developers.urbit.org).



Within these repositories, the content associated with the following examples needs to be updated to the modern React style:



1. ["Chat Lightning Tutorial"][ex-1]: Will require edits primarily in the source references, particularly those in the ["Additional commentary" section][ex-1-edit].

2. ["App School II: Full-Stack"][ex-2]: Will require nearly a full rewrite, though many source references will look similar.



## Features in scope ##



- Refactor the ["Chat" example][git-chat-src] to replace React classes with React hooks wherever possible.

- Refactor the ["Journal" example][git-jour-src] to replace React classes with React hooks wherever possible.

- Revise the ["Chat Lightning Tutorial"][git-chat-doc] documentation to update source references and add commentary to any new and nontrivial references.

- Rework the ["App School II: Full-Stack"][git-jour-doc] documentation to explain the flow and key operations (i.e. peeks, pokes, and subscriptions) of the refactored React "Journal" code.



## Implementation Notes ##



The refactored React examples will take architectural inspiration and library

cues from popular React applications in the Urbit ecosystem (e.g. [`%landscape`][git-landscape] and [`%sphinx`][git-sphinx]) to further improve their utility for learning developers.



## Milestones and Compensation ##



The grantee will receive 1 star upon fulfillment of this grant.
