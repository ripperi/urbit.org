`|mass` is a utility for measuring a pier's resource usage. It is used for debugging and development. Currently, the output of this utility is a mixture of data from within arvo and from the runtime. This heterogeneity means that what is produced is not a noun but interleaved print statements to the terminal. 

Once `|mass` produces a noun, it can be sent to other ships over `%ames` for bug reports, collected in a central location or analyzed for further action by arvo.

Update the `|mass` utility to reinject the output into arvo from the runtime.
