# Description
Tools like pastebin and Github gists allow users to easily share plain text snippets. This is useful for sharing code or simple writeups.

Implement minimal plaintext snippet sharing for Urbit, with support for both public (anyone with the path can read the snippet) and private (only invited individuals can read snippets).
