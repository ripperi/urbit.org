Hello!

We’ve quite a few updates for you this month which are covered in detail below—that said, it’s important that you know that our newsletters are splitting in two: one will continue to come from Urbit, and another from Tlon. Practically, that means that you’ll get another email from Tlon in about two weeks. Read on for more details!

1 - Developer Calls

Developer calls are coming (back)! A member of our community, ~naplet-hildec, is leading the charge to reintroduce regular calls for Urbit developers to gather and learn from one another. Each call will feature a different speaker that will present on a specific topic, followed by a Q&A. Calls will last an hour and will be held roughly every two weeks.

Expect a detailed overview on our blog (https://urbit.org/blog), announcements on https://twitter.com/urbit, and within Urbit Community soon! For now, save the date: the first developer call is on Thursday, November 5th (12PM ET, 9AM PT, 5PM UTC), and will feature a discussion about graph-store by Tlon developer ~tacryt-socryp.

2 - Weekly Design Streams

Tlon’s design team will stream for an hour every Friday (5PM ET, 2PM PT, 9PM UTC). Expect discussions on current projects, thoughts on Urbit interface design, live QA sessions, and more.

3 - Hoon School

If you’re interested in learning hoon, check out Hooniversity—the home of Hoon School—at https://hooniversity.org/. If you’re ready to enroll, join the Hooniverse group via public channel ~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse. You can also find them on Twitter as hooniversity1 or via email at join@hooniversity.org.

4 - Tlon + urbit.org Newsletters

“Ultimately, Urbit presents more possibilities than any one organization can manage.”
~wolref-podlex

If you’ve been following along with our recent dispatches, you probably know that there are some exciting changes afoot. Tlon, the company building Urbit, has been developing a plan to separate itself from the governance of urbit.org (https://urbit.org/blog/governance-of-urbit/) for quite some time. Over the past few months, we have taken concrete steps to make this separation real. It might be a good idea to revisit ~wolref-podlex’s post (https://urbit.org/blog/first-steps-towards-urbit-org/) from this summer, where he discusses what led us here and why we’re doing this now.

Urbit has matured to the point that Tlon can become just another entity in the Urbit ecosystem, so we need to separate the updates about Tlon-specific things from Urbit-specific things. Going forward, communications from Tlon and urbit.org will be issued as separate newsletters, with Tlon’s focusing on Landscape and the communities that form there, and urbit.org’s centered on Urbit’s infrastructure and community-led initiatives.

Thus, this marks the last urbit.org + Tlon newsletter—in a couple of weeks, you will receive a newsletter from Tlon. You can manage your preferences for both of these newsletters independently by unsubscribing with the footer links.

Getting on Urbit is now a lot simpler: Tlon’s hosting service is live. Join the waitlist at https://tlon.io.

That’s it for now. See you on the network!
