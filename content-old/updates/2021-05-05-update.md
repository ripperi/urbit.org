Hello!

Welcome to the May edition of the urbit.org newsletter. April was a busy month with many updates to share—let’s dig in.

0 – Updated Urbit Binaries

Urbit’s binaries were updated to v1.5 on April 27th. Make sure to download and install the latest v1.5 binaries here: https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/tag/urbit-v1.5

It’s as easy as shutting down your ship and replacing the old binaries! ~pilfer-pandex described the new release to urbit-dev as “a high priority fix for two networking bugs in urbit-king, and minor fixes to vere.”

1 – Upcoming Events

Urbit Town Hall @ May 20th 12pm PDT – Keynote from Justin Murphy
This will be Urbit’s first ever town hall—a three hour event with talks on a variety of topics and a keynote from Justin Murphy (~hatryx-lastud). Justin had Urbit Foundation Director Josh Lehman on his Other Life podcast a few weeks ago (have a listen at https://share.transistor.fm/s/1c0c8c15) and recently formed a new group on Urbit (~hatryx-lastud/other-life).

In his group, Justin has written a blog post called “Escape Velocity”, where he discusses selection effects on various platforms. Justin writes, “by creating a gravity well that sucks energy into real-estate value rather than monetized attention, Urbit exerts the lowest degree of arbitrary selection pressures on content creation, while optimizing those selection pressures that irreducibly characterize all human communication (e.g., the draw of being understood and appreciated by other people).” Tune in to Justin’s keynote on the 20th for more on Urbit as a platform for creatives.

Developer Calls @ May 13th and May 27th
As you probably know, we have developer calls every two weeks. Stay tuned for more information on our events page: https://urbit.org/events

Austin Urbit Conference @ September/October 2021
Although it’s too early to give a precise date, we are starting to plan an Urbit conference for this fall! It’ll be held in Austin, with many Urbit and Tlon employees in attendance. Stay tuned for more information!

2 – April Developer Calls

Developer Call: 3rd Party Software Distribution
In this talk, Phil (~wicdev-wisryt) and Raghu (~sovmep-ripsum) discussed the work they've been doing to clay to provide "virtual desks", an integral part of the infrastructure needed for safe, generic software distribution. This work is being done through our Scholarships program, in which community developers pair up with Tlon engineers to work on infrastructure projects. For more information about Scholarships, visit https://urbit.org/docs/development/grants/#scholarships

Developer Call: Real-Time Communication on Urbit
Edward Amsden (~ritpub-sipsyl) gave us a look at the WebRTC Airlock library he has developed that handles the hard parts of WebRTC. When complete, this will allow developers to build applications on Urbit with audio/video calling capabilities. Once again, Edward’s work is sponsored as part of the grants program (https://grants.urbit.org)—check it out!

3 – Urbit Bitcoin Launch

This was a hotly anticipated event and it didn’t disappoint. In case you missed it, Urbit will soon have a Bitcoin wallet on the network, meaning you’ll be able to pay Urbit ships directly in BTC. Watch Urbit-Tlon personnel demonstrate and discuss this exciting launch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aRnfacZPto

Make sure to check out this related blog post by Christian Langalis (~pindet-timmut): https://urbit.org/blog/interplanetary-commerce/ and this great interview with ~timluc-miptev, one of the main developers on the project: https://subject.network/posts/bitcoin-with-timluc-miptev

4 – Blog

We have a couple of new posts to announce:
“Lunar Urbit and the Internet of Things”
This post is by Poprox (~datnut-pollen), a Tlon engineer who focuses on the importance of moons in the Urbit ecosystem. The post covers “the prehistory of moons on Earth, gives a snapshot of how moons are being utilized on Urbit in 2021, covers existing issues with consumer IoT and how Urbit resolves them, and speculates what the lunar locus of the Urbit ID address space may become in the future”. Read it here: https://urbit.org/blog/iot/

“Community Spotlight: The Portico”
This post is an interview between me (~tirwyd-sarmes) and Josh Reagan (~taglux-nidsep), the founder of “The Portico”, an Orthodox Christian community. Josh has a PhD in logic, and writes about the intersection of Christianity and logic on his Urbit blog. In the interview we talk about community norms, the relationship between logic and religion, and the future of Urbit. Check out the interview: https://urbit.org/blog/community-spotlight-the-portico

5 – Odds and Ends

If you are a star or galaxy owner and are interested in sponsoring other ships, please message ~rapfyr-diglyt (david@tlon.io) to be added to the sponsors@urbit.org mailing list.

~hodzod-walrus made a page with statistics on various stars: https://bacrys.org/uptime/

~sitful-hatred beat us to the punch and released a guide on compiling Windows binaries—urbit.exe is near at hand! See the guide here: https://subject.network/posts/urbit-windows-binaries/ The official Urbit.org announcement should be around the corner, so keep your eyes peeled.

Thanks for reading. Talk to you next month!
