_Galen_ `~ravmel-ropdyl`, _Jimmy_ `~haptyl-wanwes`, and _Chris_ `~sigtus-hossyn` continue work on the new Urbit front-end.

_Ted_ `~rovnys-ricfer` and _Mark_ `~palfun-foslup` finished their month-long project of labelling the Arvo issues.

`~palfun` says:
After moving over Arvo-related issues from the Vere repository, Arvo hit >100 open issues. Knowing a lot is wrong is the
first step towards making a better product, but a big ol' pile of issues isn't really conducive to that. After
[proposing](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/572) a set of labels for our repositories to use, `~rovnys` and I set
out to show all the issues some love.
Today we finally made it through the last of them! You can now look for issues that are
[easy](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22difficulty+low%22) or [good for
contributors](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+contributor+issue%22) to
tackle. There's plenty of labels now for all your filtering needs. Internally, we'll try to get eyes on issues labeled
[RFC](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22request+for+comments%22) and [help
wanted](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) every so often.
While contributors can't add labels themselves, we'll make sure your issues get tagged correctly. Enjoy!

_Curtis_ `~sorreg-namtyv` has been helping Ted and _Anton_ `~pittyp-datfyn` with Ford. He's also continued his work on
improving default values for types in Hoon.

_Keaton_ `~tonlur-sarret` has been working on a super-secret project that he cannot discuss. Loose lips sink ships ...

_Mark_ `~palfun-foslup` has submitted a PR for Clay permissions. We just completed a second round of review, and Mark is
now doing more testing.

_Iceman_ `~littel-ponnys`, _Joe_ `~master-morzod`, and Ted [had some
fun](https://fora.urbit.org/posts/~2018.2.9..21.50.49..709f~/) discussing various forms of persistence in Clay and Gall
in `urbit-meta`.

Keaton and Ted demoed some Urbit web app examples in [Mars Talk Episode 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emWy1Afe4qY).
