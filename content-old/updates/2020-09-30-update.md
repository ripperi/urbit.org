Hello!

And just like that, it’s Autumn. We’ve disappeared into Urbit these past few months and have been hard at work, building great things:

1 - Tlon Hosting

Tlon, the company we started to get Urbit off the ground, is now offering hosting. This makes using Urbit about as easy as using any mainstream app. We’ve been enjoying using Urbit ourselves quite a bit, and we’re really excited to be able to more easily invite our friends.

Sign up for the waitlist: https://tlon.io.

There’s a secret to moving ahead in the line: reply ‘as if in a still pool’ to the question ‘How’s your day going?’ in our questionnaire. We’d like to make sure everyone on this list can get access as soon as possible.

We’re going to run a live demo showing off how our hosting service works on the 9th. You can sign up for the event here: https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/273439025/

2 - Providers

We’re not the first ones to offer hosting, it turns out. People in the community have been busy building out the first onramps into Urbit. We heard https://www.geturbitid.com, https://planet.market and https://urth.systems are all starting to come online. It’s still early, but what they have in the works is really cool to see.

We also caught wind of https://urbit.me the other day, a nice little tool for finding specific sigils.

(And we can’t forget about https://urbit.live, the first ones to get into this arena.)

I wrote a little bit about how I see the future of Urbit Providers here: https://urbit.org/blog/providers/

3 - Update + updates

There’s too much to cover in a single email, so I wrote a little post about what we’ve been working on over the past few months. Check it out on the blog: https://urbit.org/blog/20200929-state-of-urbit/

We also updated our roadmap in Understanding Urbit: https://urbit.org/understanding-urbit/roadmap/

4 - The beginning of urbit.org

We’re very happy that ~wolref-podlex has formally joined the community as Interim Director of the Urbit Foundation. We expect the foundation to become a separate entity soon, but for now we’re incubating it inside of Tlon.

Last month he wrote about how we are working to separate the governance of urbit.org from Tlon: https://urbit.org/blog/first-steps-towards-urbit-org/

Just recently, he announced the recipients of our biannual Gifts program: https://urbit.org/blog/gifts-q3-2020/

5 - Hooniversity

If you’re interested in learning Hoon, the next session of the community-run Hooniversity is set to start on October 12th.

For more information about the course, head over to the Hooniversity site: https://hooniversity.org/ and sign up for the session here: https://hooniversity.org/enroll/.

If you can't wait for the 12th, join the Hooniverse group on Urbit in advance by joining the ~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse group on Urbit or at https://twitter.com/hooniversity1

We’ve been pretty much living on Urbit as of late. If you’re curious to connect with us (and are up for running your own Urbit node) you can always find us in the Urbit Community group: ~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community. Instructions on how to install and set up Urbit are here: https://urbit.org/using/install/

We love getting questions, comments, and replies to these newsletters. One thing we heard loud and clear last time around is that you want to hear more from the team. So much happened in the past few months that we have a glut of things to talk about in the coming weeks. Expect more dispatches in the near future. For the meantime, feel free to reach out via email (support@urbit.org) any time.

See you on the network,
Galen / ~ravmel-ropdyl
