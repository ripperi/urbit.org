Hello from San Francisco!

We’re thinking of everyone in the North Bay and elsewhere who were affected by the recent fires. While we’ve had a few days of poor air quality in SF, we’re grateful that it hasn’t been as bad as last year.

Here are some updates from the Tlon team:

1 -
Tlon has been on tour! We just got back from Berlin where we gave a talk at the Lightning Conference. [Check it out](https://youtu.be/vVIt06w3IbM?t=2030). While we were there, we [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=775vmOKxwSY) to the World Crypto Network.

2 -
If you’re wondering what all this Bitcoin stuff is about, we summed it up [here](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-and-bitcoin/).

3 -
We’re offering a free, introductory-level online course on Hoon, the programming language that’s designed for use with Urbit. Hoon 101 begins on November 11th and runs for six weeks. Sign up [here](https://urbit.org/hoonschool/).

4 -
We’ve got a new version of Ames (the Urbit OS / Arvo networking protocol) compiling and up to date with master. `~pilfer-pandex` also wrote some compiler documentation that is getting rave reviews around the office. `~wicdev-wisryt` was so inspired that he added tab completion to the Dojo and built [a language server](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1910).

5 -
Kenny, a long time community member, is hosting the first-ever Urbit meetup in Seattle on November 12th. Details [here](http://meetu.ps/c/4tZGf/c0Pdg/a).

6 -
The next San Francisco meetup is on November 15th. [RSVP here](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/266146513/).

Until next time.
