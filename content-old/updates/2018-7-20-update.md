Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.7.20`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/~2018.7.13-Update-1.jpg)

The Keys team spent another week moving fast to get us on chain. _Anthony_
`~poldec-tonteg` and _Morgan_ `~hidrel-fabtel` worked on a new design for
Wallet, which will manage your Urbit address-space ownership. _Curtis_
`~sorreg-namtyv` and _Mark_ `~palfun-foslup` fortified the Constitution more.
_Will_ `~hadrud-lodsef` and _Keaton_ `~tonlur-sarret` worked to make sure that
existing address-space owners can safely and easily register their ownership
within the new system. More on this soon.

The Infrastructure team was hard at work this week. _Joe_ `~master-morzod`
merged much of his HTTPS work into the `collections` branch of Arvo and is onto
broader Arvo integration testing (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/collections)).
_Ted_ `~rovnys-ricfer`
and _Elliot_ `~littel-ponnys` cleaned up new Ford (code
[here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ford-turbo)),
trimming off several hundred lines
of code and making it easier to reason about while staying within our desired
performance goals. _Curtis_ `~sorreg-namtyv` finished the new implementation of
the `?=` ("wut-tis") rune and designed the type analysis infrastructure for the
new noun printer. _Mark_ `~palfun-foslup` produced an Urbit-specific variant of
the Argon2 password-hashing function (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/argon2)).
_Travis_ `~rigdyn-sondur`, an old friend of Tlon, has also been writing crypto
jets this week, and those will go in the kernel soon.

The Interface team has had another great week of making Urbit more usable.
_Jimmy_ `~haptyl-wanwes` has been working on a new urbit.org, written in Sail.
_Galen_ `~ravmel-ropdyl` and _Gavin_ `~ridlur-figbud` have been reviewing and
finalizing some Landscape design edits and coordinating with the frontend team.
_Chris_ `~sigtus-hossyn` and _Logan_ `~tacryt-socryp` have been implementing the
updated designs on desktop and mobile and churning through issues. _Isaac_
`~davtyr-nimren` worked on a better backend JSON interface for the Collections
app and made sure that Collections is using all of the permissioning that Clay now offers.

And the Documentation team continued their quest to teach the world Hoon. _Josh_
`~taglux-nidsep` worked more on his new Hoon tutorials (drafts [here](https://github.com/joshuareagan/doc-drafts)).
_Robert_ `~lodleb-ritrul` successfully documented the Hoon standard library cores
for date/time and hashing (PR's [here](https://github.com/urbit/docs/pulls)).

Keep on Hooning, Martians. See you in `/urbit-meta`.
