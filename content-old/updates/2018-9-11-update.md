I've gone short on words and long on links for this update, since sometimes the
code speaks for itself.

After much gnashing of teeth and abuse of git, we now have a
[release candidate](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/release-candidate)
branch (NB run with the
[correct](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/release-candidate) vere branch).
This branch brings together, for the first time, a few long-running
lines of development. `%ford-turbo`, our new and improved [reactive build
system](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/vane/ford.hoon),
totally replaces `%old-ford` on this branch (take a look at those comments!).
Proud papa _Joe_ `~master-morzod`
[hard work](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/app/acme.hoon)
on HTTPS proxying is baked right in (meaning that ship.urbit.org is graduating
from novelty to utility). `%jael` now actually [holds your
secrets](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/vane/jael.hoon)
and is being used to boot ships. _Curtis'_ `~sorreg-namtyv` swansong as the
auteur behind `hoon` is now included (a crispy new styleguide is also in the
works). Various niceties related to our new web ui are in here (_au revoir_ old
Fora and Webtalk), as well as an actually existing
[test](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/gen/test.hoon)
framework and all kinds of crypto goodies. This release candidate will get the
testnet treatment for a little while, while we confirm that it's good enough for
you, dear Martian.

Much of the Infrastructure team is living the life of the fireman: making chili
with your friends interspersed with someone yelling at you to put out a fire.
Except, instead of making chili, _Ted_ `~rovnys-ricfer` is redesigning the Ford
Rune language (why should `~sorreg-namtyv` get all the fun?) and _Elliot_
`~littel-ponnys` is bringing `%eyre` into the new Millenium. _Mark_
`~palfun-foslup` and _Joe_ `~master-morzod`, though, continue in their quest to
make Ethereum safe for Martians and _Ben_ continues his grueling (for some value
of gruel) pair programming regime with _Curtis_ `~sorreg-namtyv`.

_Chris_ `~sigtus-hossyn`, _Isaac_ `~davtyr-nimren`, _Jimmy_ `~fallyn-balfus` and
_Logan_ `~tacryt-socryp` continue refining our new web UI, Landscape. Fonts have
been argued over, tables overturned over line heights. But it will all be worth
it in the end.

The Keys crew (_Will_ `~hadrud-lodsef`, _Morgan_ `~hidrel-fabtel` and _Gavin_
`~ridlur-figbud`) are forming like Voltron to get our address space ported
over and make sure that we can generate our HD wallets in a secure, usable
way. They are joined by the newest edition to Tlon: _Jared_ `~nidsut-tomdun`.
_Jared_ is down south New Zealand way, bringing Tlon ever closer to our goal of
`%amesing` over the entire globe. Say `|hi`!

Next year on Mars!
