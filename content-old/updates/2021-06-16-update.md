Howdy!

It’s time for the June edition of the Urbit newsletter. You might have noticed that Urbit messages are being sent quicker, bitcoin wallets are flourishing, and that the network is rapidly picking up momentum in terms of users and communities. Urbit, now more than ever, is starting to feel like an organic self-sustaining ecosystem. It’s a good time to be here.

0 – Upcoming Events

Assembly: An Urbit Conference
Early October(ish) @ Austin TX
We’re busy putting together Urbit’s first IRL conference. We’ll let this email list know as soon as tickets become available.

Developer Call: Programming Bitcoin on Urbit @ Thu Jun 17, 2021 9am – 10am PDT
Tim (~timluc-miptev) will be leading an open workshop on programming bitcoin on Urbit. Come join the call to learn about this integration—all are welcome! (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltKz1MmluEY)

1 – Technical Updates

~tacryt-socryp has made a major performance improvement—sending and receiving messages are now 79% faster! He accomplished this by cutting down the time spent processing messages in arvo and he did it all despite being a newlywed. Big thanks to him!

2 – The Urbit Town Hall Event

Most of the big news this month was featured in our first ever Town Hall event, which was a big success. If you missed it, you can watch it here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YSwt0vDPj0). Here’s a quick recap of Josh’s “State of the Network” address:

- The event started off with an animation produced by ~rivpyl-sidfyl with a script by ~minder-folden (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvsOGz-hM-o). This work was commissioned via our grant program (https://urbit.org/grants/proposals/urbit-explainer-video/). Urbit grants are predominately technical but if you have artistic chops we would be interested in hearing from you.

- The grant program has been successfully churning out projects with 36 contributors in the last six months and 42 grants which are currently active. There is also a new class of grants called “apprenticeships” where a junior Urbit developer gets paired with an experienced Urbit developer to work on a project (while getting paid). Sign up before spots are gone (https://urbit.org/grants/apprenticeships/).

- Post-facto gifts were made to Urbit’s community members for exceptional contributions: ~nodreb-borrus, ~tocrex-holpen, ~habsul-rignyr, ~libhut-samwes, ~litmus-ritten, ~locpyl-tidnyd, ~sitful-hatred, ~sigryn-habrex, ~mocrux-nomdep, and ~tapruc-solwer.

- The Bitcoin Wallet application was rolled out to the network (see below).

The next two sections of the town hall featured Hunter Miller presenting on Port (see below), and Justin Murphy discussing the role of teleology in Urbit’s success. There were also some great lightning talks at the end, although they were unfortunately not recorded—you had to be there!

3 – Port (previously known as Taisho)

An important goal for Urbit has been accessibility and now, thanks to Port, it’s easier than ever to get onto the Urbit network. Port lets you boot a planet, star, or even galaxy without ever touching a terminal. If you haven’t noticed, our homepage is now prominently featuring this development. The official urbit.exe is just around the corner but get your Mac friends to boot a comet! Thanks to Urbit contributor Hunter Miller for this important achievement! (https://github.com/arthyn/port)

4 – Bitcoin Wallet

You can now send bitcoin over Urbit just by using a ship’s name—it’s that easy. The official documentation is still in the works, but ~sitful-hatred has already produced this easy guide to getting started (https://subject.network/posts/btc-wallet-config/).

5 – Gurgle.io

A new website has been causing a stir in the Urbit community. Gurgle.io is an index of the public Urbit network. If a group is public it can be crawled via a comet/planet that acts as a listener. Many Urbit users have expressed discomfort as they were not asked permission before being indexed. The developers of the project have recently decided to cease operation of the project (https://twitter.com/gurgle_io/status/1404649313020514310).

6 – Blog

~sitful-hatred has a post on the relationship between %graph-store and hypertext where he traces the historical relevance of linkages and networks. Fascinating stuff! (https://urbit.org/blog/a-topiary/)

There are two new posts from Poprox (~datnut-pollen), one on how the Urbit team is solving the problem of expensive gas prices (https://urbit.org/blog/rollups/), and the other was co-authored with Mark (~palfun-foslup) on the recent upgrade to Azimuth contracts (https://urbit.org/blog/first-contract/).

7 – New Addition to the Team

Me myself, Matt (~tirwyd-sarmes), am joining the Urbit Foundation to help with content. Please get in touch if you want to write or produce something for the blog or website (matt@urbit.org).

8 – Odds and Ends

~sipsen-pilser has released ~home-urbit, a one-stop shop for getting Urbit up and running on a home system (https://github.com/OdysLam/home-urbit).

Jake Miller (~littel-wolfur) has successfully migrated his parents and fiancée onto Urbit. Click here for an Urbit-exclusive peek into the family life of the Millers. Hi Mr. and Mrs. Miller! (https://bit.ly/35qugfK)(https://bit.ly/3wt2ZFm)

Thanks for reading. More updates next month!
