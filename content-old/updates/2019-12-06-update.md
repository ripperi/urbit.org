Wishing everyone a festive holiday season. Here are some updates from the Tlon team:

1 -
We recently released urbit v0.10.0. This continuity-breaching release contains both Arvo and Vere changes, so users should update their binaries. After upgrading, users should create new piers. Find the release binary for [macOS](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/download/v0.10.0/urbit-darwin-v0.10.0.tgz) and [linux64](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/download/v0.10.0/urbit-linux64-v0.10.0.tgz).

A few release highlights:

- Our networking vane, Ames, has been completely rewritten. Its protocol has been simplified, and several new features have been added to it. We expect Ames to be much more reliable and easy to upgrade.

- Perhaps most importantly, Ames now supports arbitrary-length negative acks, which was one of the primary networking bugs on our old network.

- Gall, our application sandbox, has also been significantly changed. This has also been a long-running project at Tlon that we’re really excited to get out on the live network. Gall itself is about a thousand lines shorter.

- The concept of "threads" is introduced. These are temporary processes for operations whose state is transient, like an http request-response.

- Includes a full redesign of the Landscape chat interface, plus adds additional features for mobile use and easier join flows.

Check out the full release notes [here](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/releases/tag/v0.10.0).

This year we set out to get Arvo to a point that we can credibly call ‘stable.' ~poldec-tonteg wrote about the details of how we accomplished stability [here](https://urbit.org/blog/stable-arvo/).
