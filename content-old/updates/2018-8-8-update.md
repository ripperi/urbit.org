Here's a short update from the team at Tlon for the week of `~2018.8.8`:

![](https://media.urbit.org/fora/updates/~2018.8.8-Update-1.jpeg)

The Interface team spent another week completing the new Urbit frontend. _Gavin_
`~ridlur-figbud` finished up his project for putting an image to your `@p`
("pat-P") (image is teaser). _Galen_ `~ravmel-ropdyl` and _Jimmy_ `~haptyl-wanwes`
did another round of design reviews for a couple of our interfaces. _Chris_
`~sigtus-hossyn` implemented Landscape functionality to reconnect to your Urbit
after a long period of disconnection (we _never_ leave `:talk`, so we of course
wouldn't know about that). _Logan_ `~tacryt-socryp` fixed some more iOS bugs and
implemented mobile in-app caching of Collections, making the app more
feature-complete. _Isaac V_ `~davtyr-nimren` continued the Collections redesign
(code [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/collections-redesign)).

The Infrastructure team put another week in forming a more perfect kernel. _Ted_
`~rovnys-ricfer` continued bug hunting in his Ford Turbo cache implementation.
_Elliot_ `~littel-ponnys` has Ford Turbo integrated with all of Arvo now, but
some last steps are still needed to be able to fully remove old Ford from the
system. You can find Ted and Elliot's code
[here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/branches/all?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=ford-turbo),
and their technical updates are posted to Fora
[here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.3.15..04.24.35..a47f~/).
As Ford Turbo has approached completion, we've realized major performance
bottlenecks in our Hoon compiler. So we've called upon _Paul_ `~fodwyt-ragful`
to help make Hoon really fast. Ted's parallelism UP has also some gotten
comments since it was posted last week -- check out the proposal
[here](https://fora.urbit.org/proposals/posts/~2018.7.28..19.57.33..7ed3~/).

The Keys team got us another week closer to getting on chain. _Joe_
`~master-morzod` now has ships booting from the keys in our testnet contract.
_Travis_ `~rigdyn-sondur` finished implementing our much-needed `secp256k1`
crypto jet (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/secp256k1)). _Mark_
`~palfun-foslup` nearly completed his `argon2-wasm` library for key
generation/derivation. Our man _Chris_ `~sigtus-hossyn` is helping him integrate
it with our other front end libraries (code [here](https://github.com/urbit/argon2-wasm)). _Anthony_ `~poldec-tonteg` and _Morgan_ `~hidrel-fabtel` are busy folding all of this new functionality into
Urbit Wallet to help you manage your ships. _Robert_ `~lodleb-ritrul` is working
on the copy for all of these apps, so that their functionality is crystal clear
to users.

Lastly: We're throwing a party next Friday, August 17th. Link: [meetup.com: Urbit IRL ~2018.8](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/253292678/). Be there!

See you on Talk, Martians.
