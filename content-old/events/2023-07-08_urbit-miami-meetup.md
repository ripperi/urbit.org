We gather at Kava Garden to discuss the times and introduce new users to the ins and outs of being on Urbit.

Discover and create new commingled interactions on a platform owned purely by you and no one else.

We'll have free planets with free hosting for a hands off solution for every participant. Look dad no hands!

Please RSVP to the Meetup page by clicking the RSVP button above.
