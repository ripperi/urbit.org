ETH Gas prices are too high! The growth of Urbit has been greatly hampered this year by the cost of activating planets. Join Philip Monk (`~wicdev-wisryt`) and the entire L2 team as they present the work completed to date to implement Layer 2 naive rollups. Come see a demo of the new Bridge front end, first migrating a star and spawning some planets, then activating a planet, all on L2.

This call will be a great opportunity for galaxy owners to get their questions answered for the upcoming vote on Layer 2 implementation. It will also be good for anyone in the community that wants a comprehensive look at how naive rollups will work to bring down planet activation costs. If you're technically inclined, be sure to check out [Philip's walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQdqCwYIBoU) of the naive rollup code ahead of time so you can ask questions.
