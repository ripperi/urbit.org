Join us on September 15th to talk to ~pilwyc-fastec about Communal Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). ~pilwyc-fastec has been studying how Urbit and Internet of Things (IoT) devices can complement each other securely. Connected devices open up new frontiers of integration and automation, but have tradeoffs in security and control worth considering as users and developers.

~pilwyc-fastec is an IoT hobbyist, smart home enthusiast, Alexa skill builder, and most recently was product manager for the identity platform, biometric recognition machine learning, and voice assistant integration for Facebookâ€™s Portal. He recently published [a blog post on Communal Computing](https://urbit.org/blog/smart-home-of-the-future).

We'll discuss how Urbit and Communal Computing ideas complement each other, and where work remains to be done. The smartest home is one you still control yourself.
