If you are new to Urbit, this is a great time and place to learn more.

Topic: open grants – what do they say about the future of Urbit and what kind of knowledge do you need to start building on them?

As always, we are also helping new people get on Urbit to try it out, answer technical questions and discuss philosophical questions around Urbit.

We have temporarily changed locations to Muted Horn, one of the best craft beer pubs in Northern Europe. It is also possible to order food from nearby restaurants and eat there. If the weather is great we will be sitting outside.

Please RSVP to the Meetup.
