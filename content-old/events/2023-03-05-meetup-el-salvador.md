Just before we all gather for the [Urbit Volcano Summit](https://summit.urbit.org) we are inviting all Urbit people that are already in town and curious locals to an Urbit meetup at the Urbit Mansion in San Salvador. The exact location will be shared with the registered attendees a few days before.

Drinks will be provided. See you there.
