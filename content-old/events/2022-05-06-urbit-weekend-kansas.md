The theme of this event is “Urbit: the Past and the Future” ~ribben-donnyl will give a talk about the history of Urbit from its accidental leak up to today. We will also discuss visions for the future of Urbit, and how we’d like to get there. If you have an idea on writing code for Urbit (or if you just want to talk Urbit runtime), we’ll have seasoned veterans on hand.

Join the group to discuss logistics, coordinate travel, and whatever’s on your mind: ~ribben-donnyl/no-coast-assembly-22
