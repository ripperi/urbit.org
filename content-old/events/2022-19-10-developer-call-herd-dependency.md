The big winner of our Hackathon will show off herd in this month's developer call. Herd is a dependency management tool for hoon. With herd, you don't have to include all the libraries you use on your application desk; instead, you get them from other desks on your ship. This talk is a walkthrough of creating a desk with herd, adding new dependencies, and running and distributing your application.

~midsum-salrux is a full-stack hoon developer. In addition to herd, he has written tendiebot (a chatbot that fetches stock and crypto prices), faux (a bridge between urbit groups and discord) and tracks (an upcoming dashboard app).
