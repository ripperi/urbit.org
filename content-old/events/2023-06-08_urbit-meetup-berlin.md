If you are new to Urbit, this is a great time and place to learn more.

Topic: App building

We are at Muted Horn, one of the best craft beer pubs in Northern Europe with a cozy vibe. It is also possible to order food from nearby restaurants and eat there. If the weather is great we will be sitting outside.

Please RSVP to the Meetup.
