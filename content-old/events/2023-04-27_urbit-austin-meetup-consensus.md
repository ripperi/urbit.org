Come hangout, drink cocktails at our open bar and talk Urbit during Consensus 2023. We will most likely have a short presentation or two from leaders of the top projects being built. We expect attendance from the Urbit Foundation, Tlon, Zorp, Uqbar, Holium, Assembly Capital and more. Rumor has it there might be free Urbit hats too.

If you haven't joined the network yet, bring a computer and we will help you get set up. Other than that we'll have some food and good tunes as well. See you there!
