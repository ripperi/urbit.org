### The easiest way to get on Urbit.

First, you get a planet with a unique name and sigil. Then, we give you the support you need to get up and running.

Every Planet purchase comes with:

**Networking keys.** 
We deliver your Planet’s networking keys via email. Take care to custody these safely! We cannot recover them for you.

**Personal Onboarding.** 
Schedule an onboarding call with us for installation help and a tour of Urbit’s userspace.

**Technical support.**
Once you’re up and running on the network, you can access our support group where our support team is available to help.

Planet Market accepts payment by credit card.
