On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by Theodore Blackman (~rovnys-ricfer), Engineering Manager at Tlon, to discuss Assembly, composability, Uqbar, and the bright future of Urbit. All this, plus Holium, Stripe, an extended carpentry metaphor, and how ~timluc has forced ~bichul to slave away in the coding gulags of Hoon School.
