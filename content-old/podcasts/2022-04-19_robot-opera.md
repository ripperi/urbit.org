This week we speak with Ted Blackman, Engineering Manager at Tlon.

We discuss Robot Opera, Inertial Navigation Systems, Y Combinator, the failure of Gesture Based Computer Interfaces, and the looming release of the remote scry protocol, which promises, upon release, to complete the system of German Idealism.
