On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by technologist and investor Brian Crain (~minwyc-dablen), CEO and co-founder of Chorus One and host of crypto's longest running podcast, Epicenter. They discuss his work building Web3 infrastructure, the evolution of Urbit (Brian just joined the Urbit Foundation board), and the next five years of crypto narratives. Then, they dive into Brian's work on Epicenter, his favorite guests, and what he has learned from spending so many years in the space. All this plus government regulation, AI-crypto integrations, and tips from a master podcaster on how we can improve The Network Age. Don't miss it.

Our thoughts go out to Brian, who is currently in the hospital recovering from his experience on this podcast.x3
