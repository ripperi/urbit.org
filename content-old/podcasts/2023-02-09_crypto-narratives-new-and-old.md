On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by esteemed CoinDesk reporters Marc Hochstein (~fodrex-malmev) and Tracy Wang to discuss the major crypto narratives of 2022. In particular, they dive into FTX (covered in-depth by Tracy for CoinDesk) and its implications for the coming year, as well as the general craziness of crypto reporting and the importance of being "long volatility." Then, the crew looks to 2023 to consider federal crypto regulation, the rise of zero-knowledge rollups, and protocol-level advances for Ethereum. All this plus polycules, Urbit, and buying Bitcoin in person from a man in the park.
