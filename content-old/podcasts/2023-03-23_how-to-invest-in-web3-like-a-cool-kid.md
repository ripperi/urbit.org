On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by Shad (~narpel-machul), the GP of Giga Corp, a crypto marketing and investment firm, to discuss liquid lobbying (using capital allocation to direct the positive development of public goods in Web3), blockchain conferences, and how to tell a real DAO from a fake one. The squad also dives deep on Urbit culture, the untapped potential of being cool in crypto, and the accelerating fusion of lifestyle with technology. All this plus diarrhea, fighting on a volcano, crypto breakfasts in Kyiv, and frontier favelas. Don't miss it.
