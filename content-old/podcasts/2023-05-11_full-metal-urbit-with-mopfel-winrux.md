Live from my heartland headquarters, another exciting episode of Zero K, an interview with ~mopfel-winrux, hardware extraordinaire.

~mopfel has a deep background in hardware: chips, robots, wiring harnesses. Today he talks about the interaction between your Urbit and the metal that it runs on. 

He also touches on a project that has since been named %lick which lets your Urbit directly control hardware like peripherals and GPUs.

You might also get a glimpse or two at the hardware plans of his company Native Planet, leading many to ask: When Urbit phone?
