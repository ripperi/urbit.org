On this extra special episode, the boys welcome a new cohost, ~habsul-rignyr of the OG Urbit podcast, The Stack (Rest in Power). More importantly, our trio of idiots is joined by famed translator, scholar, technologist, and sinophile Xianyang (~forlyt-novmep) to discuss AI-enhanced gaming, Taoist philosophy, and the creation of DAObi, a token-based simulation game of an ancient Chinese state. Then, we dive into Lexicat, Xianyang's natural language processing platform, and dissect her attempts to create GPT Burmese. All this plus: economic incentives to instantiate the AI apocalypse, the startling Confucian-Taoist rivalry, a scandalous battle for DAObi Chancellor, digital wife swapping, and how to murder a cat.
