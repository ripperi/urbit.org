This week we speak with Anthony Arroyo, better known on the network as poldec-tonteg.


Anthony is now HMFIC at the Combine, an Urbit Foundation initiative to invest in teams who want to build businesses on Urbit. In the following episode, Andy and I will offer a masterclass in pitching a podcast. And as usual, the Stack is pitch perfect, baby.
