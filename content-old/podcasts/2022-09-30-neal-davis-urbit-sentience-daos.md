Neal Davis is a Computer Science Professor at UIUC and Urbit's director of developer experience.

Since we started the UIUC Talkshow, we've said the show is about people who are sane in a way most people are crazy. Neal Davis is exactly one of them. It’s not surprise he believes we need to be weirder.

He started as a nuclear engineer but throughout his life, he's reflected on the definition of a "good and wise life." This led him to want to "elevate sentience" in his life and the life of others. A beautiful and unique pursuit.

That philosophy guides the type of work he devotes himself to and that’s he how he found Urbit, an ambitious project to rebuild and rethink the internet from first principles.

Join us on this conversation to learn more about Urbit, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Balaji’s Network States, and why the best things that happen to you are accidents.

This is the UIUC Talkshow.
