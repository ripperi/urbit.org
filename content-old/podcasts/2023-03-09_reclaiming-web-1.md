On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by Uqbar developer, Urbit explorer, and Network Age frontiersman ~dachus-tiprel to discuss the joys of peer-to-peer programming with a Web 1 aesthetic. We also touch on a few of ~dachus' recent projects, including %blog, a p2p publishing platform you can host from your own server, and %pyro, a testing script that has transformed into one of Urbit's most promising methods for low-cost hosting. All this plus "exiting", the instantiation of an IRL Party DAO, and whether programmers are more like artists or plumbers. Don't miss it.
