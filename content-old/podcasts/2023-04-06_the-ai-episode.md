On this extra special episode, the boys (including OG host ~timluc-miptev) are joined by Jake Brukhman (~ranter-tapper), the founder and CEO of Coinfund, as well as an engineer, technologist, investor, and cosmonaut exploring the frontiers of AI. The crew discusses the creation of Jargon, a Chat GPT pseudolanguage, which Jake used to build a personal AI Spanish teacher, and the implications of recent AI development. In particular, they focus on AI's implications for privacy, the intersection of AI and Web3 (including crypto as a force of decentralization), and the many types of doom that could be facing us. All this, plus how to use Chat GPT to optimize your personal life, the role of AI in education, the coming marriage between Urbit and AI, and whether interacting with AI is a religious experience. Don't miss it.
