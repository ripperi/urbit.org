On this extra special episode, the boys are joined by Luis Cuende and Anastasiya Belyaeva of Nation3, the world's first internet-native jurisdiction and "cloud nation." Luis (cofounder of Aragon) and Anastasiya discuss their network state optimism, how DAOs and smart contracts will shape a digital court system, and the benefits of becoming a Nation3 citizen. Then, they dive into capital formation in special economic zones, how digital states can support values-driven community, and the relative value of patriotism.
