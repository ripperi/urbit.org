On this extra special episode, the boys (sans ~timluc) are joined by Sam Frank (~todset-partug) of the Urbit Foundation to discuss his defection from the New York literary scene to the frontiers of distributed technology. As an early investor to both Ethereum and Urbit, Sam has witnessed how digital-first communities can organize around shared values and the pursuit of knowledge. Together, Sam and our hosts dive into the future of Urbit, the wild world of Miladies, and Sam's own journey as a writer and esoteric explorer. All this plus Urbit marriages, psychic abilities, and the importance of throwing a really good party.
