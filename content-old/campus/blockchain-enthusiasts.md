We have yet to see the promised Cambrian explosion of general-purpose decentralized applications promised by blockchains. What happened?

While blockchains are good for some problems, there remain others where a more general purpose computing solution is more useful.  This is precisely what Urbit is for.  Urbit’s vision of sound, easy-to-use, decentralized computing dovetails neatly with that of sound, easy-to-use, decentralized money.

### [Uqbar](https://uqbar.network)
The Urbit-native blockchain

The leader in this space is Uqbar, an Urbit-native layer 2 blockchain that settles on Ethereum. 

From their [clearpaper](https://uqbar-network.gitbook.io/uqbar-clearpaper/uqbar-clearpaper/uqbar-clearpaper):

>Leveraging Urbit’s peer-to-peer infrastructure, Uqbar provides a blockchain-native decentralized operating system uniquely positioned to deliver the composable primitives necessary to build a rich, functional distributed application layer. It fuses the trusted settlement of Ethereum with the decentralization, security, and interoperability benefits of full-scale peer-to-peer networking, unlocking the latent power of programmable blockchains.
