# Completed Grants

Recently completed grant projects include Urbit micro-blogging, Hoon-native Discord bridging, Urbit’s first arcade-style game, Port application improvements, Ethereum bookkeeping and eth-provider infrastructure.

* [Faux](https://urbit.org/applications/~midsum-salrux/faux) is a transformation of the python-based Urbit to Discord bridge, turning it into a Hoon native app and offering a front-end that takes you through the setup experience, letting you to bring your Discord friends a little taste of Urbit. 
* [Slam](https://urbit.org/applications/~hanfel-dovned/slam), everyone’s favorite new arcade game, integrates with [Gora](https://urbit.org/applications/~dalten/gora) and [pals](https://urbit.org/applications/~paldev/pals), utilizing a mechanism whereby the number of gorae held by your pals will influence the way your game is played.

* And Quartus delivered [Books](https://urbit.org/applications/~doller-doller-rabsef-bicrym/books), an Ethereum address and transaction manager for you to easily append notes and memos to your on chain transactions without having to rely on a third party (as a friendly reminder, [Urbit is not yet a secure environment so please be careful](https://twitter.com/pcmonk/status/1563634078779592709?s=20&t=FN7VVjMdjyIdukSvtg5_7g) what information you store on your ship). 


# Proposals

As the above grants wrap up, more grants are coming to life. Proposals are community generated and selected projects which offer contributors the space to build whatever tooling or applications they believe Urbit needs. Each of the following projects was funded in August: 



* [Herd](https://urbit.org/grants/herd) - Dependency management for Citadel
* [Full Stop](https://urbit.org/grants/full-stop) - A menstruation tracker for Urbit
* [Peat](https://urbit.org/grants/peat) - Urbit’s first backup utility

* [Urbit Interface Framework](https://urbit.org/grants/urbit-interface-framework) - Framework for alternative web browser interface
* [Whom](https://urbit.org/grants/whom) - A profile and contacts manager


# Apprenticeships

Apprenticeships are also bringing opportunities for hands-on developer education and enabling seasoned contributors to share knowledge through real world projects. And contributors get to earn address space as they learn the stack and grow their network. 

Three new apprenticeships began in August:



* [Loom Pointer Compression](https://urbit.org/grants/loom-pointer-compression) - Work to double the size of the loom
* [Build a UI for Volt](https://urbit.org/grants/volt-ui) - An interface for %volt, Urbit’s lightning wallet agent
* [Vere Profiling](https://urbit.org/grants/profiling) - Uncovering and visualized performance bottlenecks in the runtime


# Bounties

August also brings with it the assignment of previously open bounties to developers looking to grow their portfolio of Urbit projects. Many of bounties that found contributors are a part of [Holium’s App Dev Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHyzH09QaZQ), and are slated to be completed by Assembly in Miami:

* [Minesweeper](https://urbit.org/grants/minesweeper) - A classic desktop game, now natively in hoon
* [Abacus](https://urbit.org/grants/abacus) - A basic calculator app with the ability to convert units
* [Chronicle](https://urbit.org/grants/chronicle) - A news app that links articles from group channels
* [Lexicon](https://urbit.org/grants/lexicon) - A simple dictionary app with custom definitions for a group 
* [Chess Improvements](https://urbit.org/grants/chess-bounty) - An enhanced chess experience with timing and ELO servers

Even with all the claimed bounties, there remain a variety of projects which currently seek developers. Check out the following grants and apply to those that fit your skills and interests:
