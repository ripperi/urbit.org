Urbit Community, or UC, is the “Town Square” of Urbit. This group, unlike most groups on Urbit, is decidedly about Urbit.

If you’re new to the network, this is the best place to start. The team at Tlon and the Urbit Foundation hang out here to support newcomers, as well as many of the most active members of our community.

UC is where you’ll receive important news about Urbit, get support if you have any issues, and can chat with our community about nearly anything Urbit-related. Every few weeks we host an “Urbit Dialogue,” where a guest spends an hour or so answering questions AMA-style with the community.
