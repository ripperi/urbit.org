Join us for our monthly Urbit meetups in Paris!

Whether you're a tech enthusiast, an established Urbit aficionado, or a newcomer to the scene, our community is meant to welcome and engage everyone.

If you're confused about what Urbit is, no worries, most people are at first. Drop by and we'll give you our best explanations of what Urbit is and how it's going to change the internet as we know it.

We'll introduce Urbit, help you boot your own ship, and make sure you go back home all set!

See you there!
